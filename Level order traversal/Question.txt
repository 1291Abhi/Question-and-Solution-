Level order traversal



Given root of binary search tree, give its level order traversal.

Your task is to complete the function levelOrder which accepts the root of the tree as the parameter and returns an array representing the level order traversal of the BST.

Input Format
Here you are given an array as an input, and using that array, we make a binary search tree.

First line of input contains the number of Nodes.

Second line contains the value of the nodes.

Note

The BST being formed is height balanced. You can assume that we are sorting the input list and using the middle element to create the root of the tree. Then calling recursively for the left and right subtrees with the remaining left and right halves of the sorted array excluding the middle element. This will create the height balanced BST.

Output Format
Return the level order traversal of the given tree.

Example 1
Input

5
2 4 15 6 3
Output

4 2 6 3 15
Explanation

       4
      /  \
    2    6
     \      \
     3      15
level order traversal of the binary search tree from the given array as input is 4 2 6 3 15.
Example 2
Input

3
3 2 1
Output

2 1 3
Explanation

       2
      /   \
     1    3
level order traversal of the binary search tree from the given array as input is 2 1 3.
Constraints
1 <= Number of nodes <= 2000

-1000 <= value of each node <= 1000
