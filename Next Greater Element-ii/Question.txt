Next Greater Element-ii


Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, print -1 for this number.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n. Second line contains n spaced integers.

Output Format
Print the next greater element for each array value and if it doesnt exist then print -1

Example 1
Input

3
1 2 1
Output

2 -1 2
Explanation

The first 1's next greater number is 2;

The number 2 can't find next greater number.

The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Example 2
Input

6
1 2 3 4 3 3
Output

2 3 4 -1 4 4
Explanation

Here , next greatest of 1st element is 2. Next greatest of second is 3 ans similarly we will check next larger even circularly.

Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
