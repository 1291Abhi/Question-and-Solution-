Get KPC
You are given a string s consisting of numbers, where each number corresponds to a number of alphabets like in keypad-phones. The mapping is as follows:

    0 -> .;
    1 -> abc
    2 -> def
    3 -> ghi
    4 -> jkl
    5 -> mno
    6 -> pqrs
    7 -> tu
    8 -> vwx
    9 -> yz
From this given s you need to find the numbers of words of size 4 that can be made.

Note: Try solving this question with a recursive approach.
