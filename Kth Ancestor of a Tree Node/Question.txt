Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node




You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of ith node. The root of the tree is node 0. Find the kth ancestor of a given node.

Return the kth ancestor of a tree node or if no such ancestor is present return -1. It is the kth node in the path from that node to the root node.

Input Format
First line contains n.

Next line contains n spaced integers of parent array.

Next line contains node and k.

Output Format
Return the kth ancestor of a tree node is the kth node in the path from that node to the root node or if no such ancestor is present return -1.

Example 1
Input

7
-1 0 0 1 1 2 2
5 2
Output

0
Explanation

        0
    1         2
  3   4    5    6

Observe from the tree that the node 5''''s 2nd ancestor is the node 0.
Example 2
Input

7
-1 0 0 1 1 2 2
6 3
Output

-1
Explanation

        0
    1         2
  3   4    5    6

There is no 3rd ancestor of the node 6 so output is -1.
Constraints
1 <= k <= n <= 5 * 10^4

parent.length == n

parent[0] == -1

0 <= parent[i] < n for all 0 < i < n

0 <= node < n
