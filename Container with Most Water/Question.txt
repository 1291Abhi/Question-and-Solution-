Container with Most Water



Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Your program should print an integer that corresponds to the maximum area of water that can be contained ( Yes, we know maximum area instead of maximum volume sounds weird. But this is a 2D plane we are working with for simplicity ).

Note: You may not slant the container.

Input Format
line 1: contains an integer n denoting the size of the array.

line 2: contains n-spaced integers denoting elements of the array.

Output Format
Print the most water that can be contained.

Example 1
Input

4
1 5 4 3 
Output

6
Explanation

5 and 3 are distance 2 apart. So size of the base = 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So total area = 3 * 2 = 6

Example 2
Input

3
1 2 3
Output

2
Explanation

2 and 3 are distance 1 apart. So size of the base = 1. Height of container = min(2, 3) = 2. So total area = 2 * 1 = 2

Constraints
n == array size of height array.

2 <= n <= 100000

0 <= height of each point <= 10000
