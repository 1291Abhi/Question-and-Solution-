Island Perimeter





You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Input Format:
First line consists of an integer r and c representing number of rows and columns respectively

The next r lines contain c integers each representing the island

Output Format:
Print the perimeter of the island

Example 1:
Input:

4 4
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
Output::

16
Explanation:

The contribution of perimeters of each element to the total has been described below:

0 3 0 0
3 0 3 0
0 2 0 0
3 2 0 0
Example 2:
Input:

1 1
1
Output::

4
Explanation

It is a simple square of 4 sides each of length 1 unit.

CONSTRAINTS:
row == grid.length

col == grid[i].length

1 <= row, col <= 100

grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

There is exactly one island in grid.
