Counting Triangles


You are given an array of N non-negative integers, A0, A1 ,…, AN-1.

Considering each array element Ai as the edge length of some line segment, count the number of triangles which you can form using these array values.

Notes:

You can use any value only once while forming each triangle. Order of choosing the edge lengths doesn’t matter. Any triangle formed should have a positive area.

Return answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input Format
First line contains an integer of length n

Second Line contains n spaced elements

Output Format
Print the no. of triangles formed modulo 10^9 + 7

Example 1
Input

4
4 6 3 7
Output

3
Explanation

There are three triangles possible {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}.

Note: that {3, 4, 7} is not a possible triangle.

Example 2
Input

4
7 3 6 4
Output

3
Explanation

The output should be 3 because there are 3 possible triangles, viz.: {3, 4, 6}, {3, 6, 7} and {4, 6, 7}.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^3

1 <= A[i] <= 10^3
